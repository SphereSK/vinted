# Product Requirements Document: Vinted Scraper Extensions

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for extending the Vinted Scraper application with new features to improve its reliability, flexibility, and data quality.

## 2. Goals

*   To improve the reliability of the scraper by implementing a more robust detail fetching mechanism.
*   To make the scraper more resilient to errors and network issues.
*   To extend the scraper's functionality to support more Vinted locales.
*   To improve the quality of the scraped data by adding a data cleaning and normalization pipeline.

## 3. Features

### 3.1. Full Browser Automation for Details

*   **User Story:** As a user, I want the scraper to reliably fetch detailed information for each listing, even when faced with anti-bot measures like Cloudflare, so that I can get complete and accurate data.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Integrate a headless browser solution (e.g., `undetected_chromedriver`) to fetch the full HTML of listing detail pages.
    *   Replace the current `requests`-based detail fetching with the new browser-based implementation.
    *   Ensure that the browser-based implementation is efficient and does not significantly slow down the scraping process.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   A significant reduction in the number of failed detail fetches.
    *   The ability to consistently scrape detailed information (description, all photos, etc.) for all listings.

### 3.2. Improved Error Handling and Resilience

*   **User Story:** As a user, I want the scraper to be more resilient to errors and network issues, so that it can continue scraping even when it encounters temporary problems.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Implement more specific error handling for different types of exceptions (e.g., network errors, parsing errors, database errors).
    *   Implement a more sophisticated retry mechanism with exponential backoff for handling temporary network problems.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   A reduction in the number of scraper failures due to temporary errors.
    *   The ability of the scraper to automatically recover from temporary errors and continue its work.

### 3.3. Support for More Vinted Locales

*   **User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to scrape listings from different Vinted locales, so that I can collect data from multiple countries.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Refactor the code to allow the Vinted locale to be a configurable option.
    *   Handle any differences in the website structure or API endpoints for different locales.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   The ability to successfully scrape listings from at least three different Vinted locales (e.g., `sk`, `com`, `fr`).

### 3.4. Data Cleaning and Normalization

*   **User Story:** As a user, I want the scraped data to be clean and normalized, so that I can easily analyze and use it.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Add a data processing pipeline to clean and normalize the scraped data.
    *   Standardize brand names (e.g., "Sony" and "sony" become the same).
    *   Convert sizes to a consistent format.
    *   Parse more structured data from the descriptions.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   A noticeable improvement in the quality and consistency of the scraped data.
    *   The ability to perform more accurate analysis on the scraped data.
