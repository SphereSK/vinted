# Task ID: 7
# Title: DB migration for locale and normalized fields
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend schema and models to store `locale`, `brand_normalized`, and `size_normalized` required by the cleaning pipeline and analytics.
# Details:
- Migration SQL in `migrations/`: add columns if not exist: `locale VARCHAR(8)`, `brand_normalized VARCHAR(128)`, `size_normalized VARCHAR(64)` to `vinted.listings`.
- Update `app/db/models.py` mapped columns and `app/api/schemas.py` to include these as optional fields.
- Upsert path in `app/ingest.py` should pass through `locale` when known.
- Backfill script: set `brand_normalized = LOWER(brand)` initial seed where null.

# Test Strategy:
- Apply migration on dev DB; verify ORM reflects new columns and API responses include them when present.
- Unit: serialization round-trip through Pydantic includes optional fields.
